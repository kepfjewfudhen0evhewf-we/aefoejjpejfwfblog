# 👋 Welcome to My Blog!

Hey there! I’m **Zre** — welcome to my little digital space.

This is my very first post, and I'm hyped to kick things off. I created this blog to document and share my thoughts, projects, and insights on topics I'm passionate about, including:

- 💻 **Coding** — From scripts to full-stack projects  
- 🛡️ **Cyber Security** — Exploring threats, defenses, and ethical hacking  
- 🌐 **Networking** — The backbone of the internet, one packet at a time  
- 🔐 **Digital Privacy** — Because your data matters

Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast or just curious about these topics, I hope you find value here.

Thanks for dropping by — and stay tuned for more deep dives, tutorials, and thoughts.

Catch you in the next post!  
**– Zre**
