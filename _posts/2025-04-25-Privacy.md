# Digital Privacy And Security Starter Guide



The first step I recommend is switching your primary email provider to a more privacy-focused option such as ProtonMail or Tutanota.
These services offer end-to-end encryption and robust security features, providing significantly more privacy than mainstream providers like Gmail. Additionally, using a decentralized and secure email platform helps eliminate a major single point of failure in your digital life.



The second step is to consider changing your web browser—especially if you're currently using Chrome.
I highly recommend privacy-respecting alternatives such as Brave or Vivaldi for everyday browsing. These browsers are designed with user privacy in mind, offering features like built-in ad and tracker blocking, without compromising on performance or usability.



The third recommendation is to use different aliases for most of your online accounts and to maintain a clear separation between your digital and real-life social media presence.
In practice, this means avoiding any overlap between the two: do not add real-life contacts to your digital social media accounts, and similarly, refrain from connecting with digital acquaintances on your personal or real-world social platforms. This separation helps protect your identity, maintain privacy, and reduce the risk of cross-platform tracking or doxxing. 



Fourth, I recommend fully "de-Googling" your digital life by transitioning away from Google services where possible.
This could mean switching from Google Drive to privacy-focused alternatives like MEGA, and using collaborative document tools that don’t rely on Google’s infrastructure—such as the very platform used to create this document aka ddocs. While Google services are undeniably convenient, they represent a significant central point of failure and a major source of data collection. Reducing dependence on them is a key step toward regaining control over your digital privacy.



Fifth, I strongly recommend using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to mask your IP address and enhance your online privacy.
A reliable VPN encrypts your internet traffic and routes it through a secure server using protocols like WireGuard or OpenVPN. This helps conceal your IP address and prevents third parties from tracking your online activity. It’s essential to choose a trusted, no-logs VPN provider—some reputable options include Mullvad, IVPN, Proton VPN, and Windscribe, all known for their strong privacy policies and solid performance.



Sixth, I recommend using ToS;DR (Terms of Service; Didn’t Read), a free, community-driven platform that simplifies and summarizes privacy policies and terms of service.
Before signing up for a service or making a purchase, it's crucial to understand how a company handles your data. ToS;DR provides concise, user-friendly summaries and ratings of terms and privacy policies, helping you make more informed decisions about the platforms and services you use.



Seventh, I highly recommend using a reputable password manager, as storing your passwords directly in your browser is not secure.
A password manager helps ensure that your login credentials are stored securely and encrypted. Proton Pass is an excellent choice, offering robust security features and seamless integration with other privacy-focused tools. I strongly advise avoiding platforms like LastPass, which have suffered numerous security breaches and are generally regarded as less secure due to their vulnerabilities.

Remember, online privacy isn’t just for individuals who “have something to hide.” It’s for anyone who values their personal data and doesn’t want companies profiting from their information without consent.
